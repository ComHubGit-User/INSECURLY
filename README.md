# INSECURLY
<strong>Overview:</strong> "Insecurly" is a piece of code or a script designed to bypass or disable the web filtering features of the Securly browser extension. This extension is commonly deployed in educational or corporate environments to ensure safe and responsible use of the internet. While "Insecurly" may exploit vulnerabilities or manipulate the local browser environment to neutralize the filtering, it's important to note that such actions can be against policies, terms of service, or even legal regulations.

<strong>Workflow of the Code:</strong>

Detection: The code first identifies if the Securly extension is actively running in the browser.

Bypass Mechanism: Disables Securly's filtering extension

Network Traffic Modification: The code might alter or block requests to Securly's servers, effectively cutting off the filtering mechanism.

<strong>Risks & Ethical Considerations:</strong>

Ethical Violations: Bypassing security filters can breach school or organizational rules.

Security Risks: These actions may inadvertently expose systems to vulnerabilities or create security loopholes.

Legal Consequences: Tampering with or bypassing security measures may violate local laws, terms of service agreements, or organizational policies.

Important Note: If you are working in a network security or penetration testing capacity, it's crucial to ensure you have explicit permission from the system's administrator before attempting any sort of bypass or vulnerability testing. Unauthorized actions can have serious consequences. <mark>Not for students to use without permission</mark>

<strong>We are not to blame for the consequences if you choose to apply this code.</strong>
